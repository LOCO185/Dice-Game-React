# Dice Game Project

### This is my first ever React Project i do. a Dice game project
## How to play : 
1. You can enter a number inside the input field or leave it empty, if you leave it Empty it'll be set to default score which is 100
2. Click on Roll Dice Button and start rolling the dice. after first Roll the input field will be locked and you cannot change the points to win score.
3. If you reach any kind of doubles you'll lose your current score and pass your turn to the second player
4. Press on the HOLD button to add your current score to your total and pass over the turn to the other player

# Project Build
## This is how the game looks like :

# Project Funcions
# I used multiple functions to build the logic of this game
1. Roll Dice Function
2. Hold / Pass Turn Function
3. New Game Function

## What does each function do?
### Roll Dice : Picks a random number between 1 to 6, and then display in the gameSettings container two images of the dice according to the selected number
### Hold Function : Adds the the currentScore to the totalplayer score and then passes the turn to the other player
### New Game : Easiest function you can come across.. just re set the state to its default

###
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
